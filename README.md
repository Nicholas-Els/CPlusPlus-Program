How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Having user stories keeps everyone focused and up to date on what is required. There is no overlap when done this way. User stories implement only what is in the story. And finally, user needs go directly into each story when the project is first started. If more is needed to define the user stories, only the appropriate stories are modified.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approached it like I was just started coding. I knew I was going to mess up, but that is the whole point of Agile. To mess up and learn so that I can keep on improving. I hope to add more interactions into my practise, and rely less on tools to tell me how to code. This will come in time.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member is to communicate at all times. Let them know if you are struggling. If they are good team members too, they will help. Just don't be afraid to talk with one another.
